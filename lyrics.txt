Nothing Else Matters Lyrics

So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words, I don't just say
And nothing else matters

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

So close, no matter how far
It couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

One Lyrics

I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or a dream
Deep down inside, I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh, please, God, wake me

Back in the womb, it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

Oh, God, help me

Darkness, imprisoning me
All that I see, absolute horror
I cannot live, I cannot die
Trapped in myself, body my holding cell
Landmine, has taken my sight
Taken my speech, taken my hearing
Taken my arms, taken my legs
Taken my soul, left me with life in Hell

New blood joins this Earth, and quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace, the young boy learns their rules
With time the child draws in, this whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts, the young man struggles on and on, he's known
Ooh, a vow unto his own that never from this day
His will they'll take away, yeah

Never shined through in what I've shown

Throughout his life the same, he's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win, a tired man they see no longer cares

Make his fight, on the hill, in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run, through the endless grey
On they fight, for their right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill — Why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive, through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know

For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls


Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time you will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now are his eyes to this mystery
Hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone, except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see

Life, it seems, will fade away
Drifting further every day
Getting lost within myself
Nothing matters, no one else
I have lost the will to live
Simply nothing more to give
There is nothing more for me
Need the end to set me free


Things not what they used to be
Missing one inside of me
Deathly lost, this can't be real
Cannot stand this hell I feel
Emptiness is filling me
To the point of agony
Growing darkness taking dawn
I was me, but now he's gone

No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
Now I can't think, think why I should even try
Yesterday seems as though it never existed
Death greets me warm, now I will just say goodbye
Goodbye

Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labelled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep, my friend, and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says "rage"?

Leave me be
Sanitarium
Just leave me alone


Build my fear of what's out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell

What is this hell you have put me through?
Believer, deceiver
Day in, day out, lived my life through you
Pushed onto me what's wrong or right
Hidden from this thing that they call life
Dear mother, dear father
Every thought I'd think you'd disapprove
Curator, dictator
Always censoring my every move
Children are seen but are not heard
Tear out everything inspired

Innocence, torn from me without your shelter
Barred reality, I'm living blindly

Time has frozen still, what's left to be?
Hear nothing, say nothing
Cannot face the fact I think for me
No guarantee it's life as is
But damn you for not giving me my chance

Unspoiled, unspoken

Same thing I've always heard from you

We're scanning the scene
In the city tonight
We're looking for you
To start up a fight

But it's nothing new
You know it drives us insane

Dying, one thousand deaths

But the devil take that woman, yeah, for you know she tricked me easy

How could he know this new dawn's light
Would change his life forever?
Set sail to sea but pulled off course
By the light of golden treasure
Was he the one causing pain
With his careless dreaming?
Been afraid, always afraid
Of the things he's feeling
He could just be gone
He would just sail on
You would just sail on

How can I be lost
If I've got nowhere to go?
Searched for seas of gold
How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost?
In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you
When it's me I can't forgive?

These days drift on inside a fog
It's thick and suffocating
This seeking life outside its hell
Inside intoxicating
He's run aground, like his life
Water much too shallow
Slipping fast, down with the ship
Fading in the shadows
Now a castaway
They've all gone away

On a long and lonesome highway east of Omaha
You can listen to the engines moaning out its one old song
You can think about the woman, or the girl you knew the night before
But your thoughts will soon be wandering the way they always do
When you are riding sixteen hours and there's nothing much to do
You don't feel much like riding, you just wish the trip was through

But here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
There I go, playing the star again
There I go, turn the page
So you walk into this restaurant, strung out from the road
And you feel the eyes upon you, as you're shaking off the cold
You pretend it doesn't bother you, but you just want to explode
And most times you can't hear them talk, other times you can
All the same old cliches: is it woman? Is it man?
And you always seem outnumbered, you don't dare make a stand, make your stand

But here I am, on the road again
There I am, up on the stage
Here I go, playing the star again
There I go, turn the page

You smoke the day's last cigarette, remembering what she said

Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be, a servant 'til I fall

Better just stay down
You pull away, he hits the flesh, you hit the ground
Mouth so full of lies
Tend to black your eyes
Just keep them closed, keep praying, just keep waiting

But the sunshine never comes, no
No, the sunshine never comes

Push you cross that line
Just stay down this time
Hide in yourself, crawl in yourself, you'll have your time

Take it back one day

Do you see what I see? Truth is an offense
You silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear? Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination, keep you where they must
Do you feel what I feel? Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?
Do you take what I take? Endurance is the word
Moving back instead of forward seems to me absurd

Doesn't matter what you see
Or intuit what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say

Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception

Do you fear what I fear? Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose? More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative
Do you need what I need? Boundaries overthrown
Look inside, to each his own
Do you trust what I trust? Me, myself and I
Penetrate the smoke screen, I see through the selfish lie

We're so fucked, shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destruct
Oh


Once upon a planet burning, once upon a flame
Once upon a fear returning all in vain
Do you feel that hope is fading? Do you comprehend?
Do you feel it terminating in the end?

Wish I may
Wish I might
Have this I wish tonight
Are you satisfied?
Dig for gold
Dig for fame
You dig to make your name
Are you pacified?

All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased

Then it all crashes down
And you break your crown
And you point your finger
But there's no one around
Just want one thing
Just to play the king
But the castle's crumbled
And you're left with just a name
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
Where's your crown?

Careful what you wish
You just might get it

38 ContributorsMama Said Lyrics
Mama, she has taught me well
Told me when I was young
"Son, your life's an open book
Don't close it 'fore it's done"
"The brightest flame burns quickest"
Is what I heard her say
A son's heart's owned to Mother
But I must find my way

Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or, let this heart be still (be still)

"Rebel," my new last name
Wild blood in my veins
Apron strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
Left home at an early age
Of what I heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what is said is done

But never I gave
But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
So let this heart be still

Mama, now I'm coming home
I'm not all you wished of me
But a mother's love for her son
Unspoken, help me be
I took your love for granted
And all the things you said to me, yeah-yeah
I need your arms to welcome me
But a cold stone's all I see
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Or, let this heart be still
Let my heart go
Mama, let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So, let this heart be still

Never I ask of you

But you gave me your emptiness
I now take to my grave
Never I ask of you

But you gave me your emptiness

Dealing out the agony within
Charging hard, and no one's going to give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty
Inbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submission
Following our instinct not a trend
Go against the grain until the end

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
(Damage Incorporated)

Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood, and we make sure
Life isn't for you, and we're the cure
Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name, and you shall fall

All flee, with fear you run

Go


Damage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this, it gets me going
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
Fuck it all, and fucking no regrets
Never happy endings on these dark sets
All's fair for Damage Inc., you see
Step a little closer, if you please

Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here

Blacked out
Pop queen, amphetamine
The screams crashed into silence
Tapped out
Doused in the gasoline
The high times going timeless

Decadence
Death of the innocence
The pathway starts to spiral
Infamy
All for publicity
Destruction going viral

Light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, kill the truth
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again

Sold your soul
Built a higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away
Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame

Come unto me and you will feel perfection
Come unto me and dedicate
Come unto me, you'll never feel rejection
Come unto me and terminate
Remove your heart, it's only good for bleeding
Bleeding through your fragile skin
Remove your thought 'cause it's only for deceiving
Deceiving thoughts destroy within

Disappear like man was never here

The future supreme
Man overthrown
Spit out the bone

Plug into me, I guarantee devotion

Living and dying, laughing and crying
Once you have seen it, you'll never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it's heavy, it's dirty and mean

Motorbreath, it's how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
It is going to take your breath away

Don't stop for nothing, it's full speed or nothing
I am taking down you know whatever is in my way
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down my spine

Another star denies the grave
See the nowhere crowd, cry the nowhere tears of honor

Hide and swallow mansions whole
Dim the light of an already faded primadonna
